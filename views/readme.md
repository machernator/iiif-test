The folder `views` is used by [fatfree frameworks](https://fatfreeframework.com/) templating system. The file `views/index.html` is the main file. It includes all the other components of a page. Views are stored in these folders:

* layout
* content
* sidebars
* components
* forms
* modals
* ~~nav~~

`views/nav` is not used in this project.

### layout

This folder contains all the main elements of the sites html layout elements.

### content

Each pages route loads an html page from this folder. The Controller function called by the route sets the content like this: `$f3->set('content', $this->content('home'));` The name of the content is the same as the html files name without the .html extension.

### sidebars

Sidebar content is optional and can be set in the routes Controller function like this: `$f3->set('contentSidebar', 'sidebar-creators');`. The name of the content is the same as the html files name without the .html extension. Sidebar is optional.

### components

Components are layout elements that can be included in multiple pages in different layout regions. For example status, filters, search elements... should be stored in this folder.
